### 💽 Script Versions

#### Full Version (`NewPC.ps1`)
This version includes the `Invoke-RobustDownload` function. If `7-Zip` or `AnyDesk` installers are not found locally, it will prompt the user to download them from the official websites.

#### Offline Version (`NewPC_offline.ps1`)
This version does not include the download functionality. It assumes all necessary installers are already present in the script's folder. If an installer is not found, the corresponding installation step is skipped.
